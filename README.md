# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).


### Purpose

This is a web application that I am building to practice my React skills.

So basically this is a website is an all in one platform that is integrated with several functionalities like Video and music streaming, Online Chatting, Posting blogs, personal or professional videos, images etc.


Primarily the website is a one time login application which doesn't ask you to login to the different platforms present in the site. So it is easy to use.


The main aim of this site is to provide all functionalities and bring all the streaming , social media platforms into a single atmosphere which will make the user experience much more fun and easy to use.


So folks if you use this app you don't need to switch to other apps for your notifications and miss your videos....You can switch to the next page in a second.....all the applications are at your finger tips.
